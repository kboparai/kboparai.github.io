        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This Co-op was my introduction to writing code outside of coursework so I had a great deal to learn and it has provided me with a solid foundation. I also found out how much work goes into making sure students have a positive learning experience and therefore has pushed me to take my remaining courses more seriously. I am happy that code wrote by me will be used to give feedback to other students and for the first time code wrote by me is actually being used.</p>

        <p>I learned a great deal about programming with Java and object-oriented principles like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheriance and Polymorphism. I also gained experience working with project build and automation tools like gradle, working with 'Checkstyle' which is a static code analysis tool, XML files, JSON and fat JAR's. This co-op postion has made me more confident writing code and has prepared me for working in a professional software job.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This Co-op was my introduction with a professional IT environment so I had a great deal to learn and it has provided me with a solid foundation. I gained experience with troubleshooting and working around with the registry for the Microsoft Suite, Citrix, OneDrive Desktop Client, Maas360, ServiceFirst, NetVCR, ISE, SCEP as well as SCCM actions. To add, I have also sharpened my troubleshooting, communication, critical thinking and problem solving skills. This job has made me realize how important IT support is for the smooth operation of a company. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at The Co-operators.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #BD5D38">Academic Relation</h2>
        <p>This co-op work term has definitely enhanced my academic experience. Problem solving is the most key skill when it comes to the software courses I have at the University of Guelph and this job has taught me how to break down and analyze problems in order to pinpoint what the exact issue is i.e root-cause analysis and also to fix the issue at it's root so it does not repeat itself. Due to the varied nature of issues I had to work on, the job has conditioned me to look at each problem from a number of angles and also to think outside of the box. This job has also further strengthened my understanding of a computer's working by introducing me to the Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager and RegEdit.</p>
        <h2>Focus of the Report</h2>
        <p>The main focus of my work term was resolving incidents based on a ticketing system and the most important aspect of that was documentation. Throughout my academic courses, I have learned how important commenting is when writing code, and now I understood the real importance for that. Not only did I have to read the work notes that were entered before the issue was escalated to me but also carefully document every step I took in the troubleshooting process. Whenever a workaround or resolution for an issue was found, my responsibility was to create 'Knowledge Articles' that outlined the issue, the symptoms of the issue and the steps to be followed for it's resolution. These Knowldege Articles would be used by the IT Helpdesk so that the issue could be resolved in a timely manner without the need for escalation the next time it was encountered. I also had to create and/or update documentation for Technical Support staff when new hardware or software was introduced into the environment</p>
